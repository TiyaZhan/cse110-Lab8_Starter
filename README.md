1) Within a Github aciton that runs whenever code is pushed
Having the test in Github means that it can be ran with the other automated styling test, so all test can be ran at the same time. Also, having the test on Github so that we are somewhat confident with our code before testing. Thus, we do not completely rely on the testing to write our code. Manually running test is not promissing because we could forget this step before we push to GitHub, so having automated checker on Github is important so that we don't merge something wrong into the main when we forget to run test locally. 

2) no

3) I won't use unit test to test the message feature, because unit test cannot test how individual components interact with each other on application level. Message feature involves inputing messages, sending message and checking if it is correctly send. Since it involves multiple aspects, unit test is not best choice to test it.

4) I would use unit test to test the max message length, because it just a simple aspect and does not involves interaction with other components.
