1) Manually run them locally before pushing code
It is important to make sure your code work on certain extent before commiting to the origin. Based on what Prof.Powell said in the testsing section, quality check such as style checking and running unit test locally are necessary steps before every commit. Testing locally before commit can avoid conflicts. Pushing unverified code to Github might lead to more work or confusion to others if working in a group.

2) no

3) I won't use unit test to test the message feature, because unit test cannot test how individual components interact with each other on application level. Message feature involves inputing messages, sending message and checking if it is correctly send. Since it involves multiple aspects, unit test is not best choice to test it.

4) I would use unit test to test the max message length, because it just a simple aspect and does not involves interaction with other components.
